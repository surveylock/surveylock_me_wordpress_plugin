== Description ==


SurveyLock is a simple yet powerful monetization alternative for WordPress users with some awesome benefits!


*   Better revenue

Many publishers find that they make more with SurveyLock than through their traditional display ads. Most use a combination of the two to improve site experience while multiplying revenue by 1.5x, 2x and even 3x!


*   Better user experience

Many publishers find that since using SurveyLock outperforms traditional display ads on their website, they can scale back on ad clutter and provide a more positive user experience to their visitors.


*   Better SEO

When publishers minimize traditional display ads, page load times are dramatically decreased, allowing for both a better user experience and a potential increase in Google rankings.



There are two main integrations:


*   Content Integration

Can be used on any WordPress website. Simply place the shortcode [slm_content_lock]  content  [/slm_content_lock] around any content in any post that you'd like to hide. When visitors see your post, they'll be able to unlock the content by completing a quick survey, and you'll get paid.

*   Snax Quiz Integration

For the popular Snax viral content plugin, monetize personality or trivia quizzes by requiring a quick survey before a user retrieves their results.





== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is SurveyLock? =

SurveyLock is a simple WordPress plugin that allows you to "lock" certain pieces of valuable content on your website with a safe, simple and authentic brand survey. When visitors complete the anonymous ~30 second survey, content is unlocked and you're paid.

= What kinds of surveys do visitors see? =

The surveys that visitors see are from nationally recognized brands that users will be familiar with. Most surveys are simple multiple choice and can take just 30 seconds to complete.

Every survey your visitors see will be 100% brand safe and authentic, and will never ask for personally identifiable information.

= How much extra revenue can I make? =

We can't provide accurate projections because content & visitor type vary between websites. However, the majority of publishers who implement SurveyLock find that it meets or even exceeds the revenue they generate from traditional display ads.
